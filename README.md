# SkyUI_2020

Effort to update [SkyUI SE](https://github.com/schlangster/skyui) to 2020 standards of UI files for Skyrim, by converging multiple sources. All credits belong to SkyUI team, and Mardoxx for his original [Skyrim Legendary Source](https://github.com/Mardoxx/skyrimui) of reverse engineered UI files. Closer Information about permission and credits can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/Mardoxx/skyrimui) and [here](https://github.com/schlangster/skyui). The source for Skyrim SE VR can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/Odie/skyui-vr):

Additionally to the available sources, reverse engineered, up to date Skyrim SE UI files will be provided whereever needed. Uploads will happen by menu/UI type. The final goal is to provide source files for the whole of Skyrim SE, not only SkyUI. Tools used:

1. [Adobe Flash 6](https://www.adobe.com/cy_en/downloads/other-downloads.html): Action Script 2.0, Flash Player 11.2 standards
2. [jPexs Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)

None of the files will be provided standalone. So the prerequisite will always be to first install the original SkyUI, or the sources provided by Mardoxx and Odie.
